# CS332-Assign Repository

This repository contains assignments and summaries for the **Software Design Method(CSED332)** course, along with **Clean Code** chapter summaries.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:
- **Software Design Method** course assignments
- **Clean Code** chapter summaries
- Personal assignments related to **Functional Programming** using **Scala**

### Functional Programming - Scala
For this course, individual assignments focus on **functional programming** concepts using **Scala**. The solutions demonstrate the practical application of functional programming principles such as immutability, higher-order functions, and recursion.

### Clean Code Summaries
The repository also contains summaries of key chapters from **Clean Code** by Robert C. Martin. These summaries highlight the best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and readable code.
